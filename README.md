This project is a mock frontend for a non-existent news site made to test out several technologies and concepts I am experienced with, or am learning.

It is (or will be) made up of the following technologies:

* NPM for package management
* Vue for designing UI functionality
  * Vuex for state management
  * Vue Router for adding SPA functionality
* TailwindCSS for UI style
* Vue Test Utils and Jest for unit testing
* Cypress for E2E testing

Possible future features (trying not to introduce feature creep):

* Integration with a Headless CMS (e.g. Strapi)
* User accounts (without the actual functionally, just as a mock concept to show a possible frontend)
